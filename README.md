# Symfony OpenAPI Playground

## Encountered Issues

## Podman usage and volumes mounting issue

- <https://www.tutorialworks.com/podman-rootless-volumes/>
- <https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/rootless-podman-user-namespace-modes>
- <https://github.com/containers/podman-compose/issues/166>

## OpenAPI Generator to simplify implementation

- Really simple tutorial: <https://pguso.medium.com/openapi-generator-use-symfony-bundle-in-your-project-28034505548d>
- Convert old annotations generated by the generator into attributes: <https://www.dannyvankooten.com/blog/2023/rector-annotations-to-attributes/>
    - Makes the validators work again as Symfony 7 doesn't support annoations
      anymore. Thanks [Rector](https://github.com/rectorphp/rector) !
